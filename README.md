**Project Title**

Evaluating Machine Learning Models for Credit Risk Assessment


**Overview**
An applied machine learning project analysing how different classification models perform in credit risk assessment, with a focus on accuracy, interpretability, and decision impact in financial contexts. This project applies and evaluates multiple machine learning models to assess credit risk decisions using structured financial data. The aim is to analyse how different models perform in predicting creditworthiness and to understand their implications for real-world financial decision-making.

**Problem Statement**

Credit risk assessment is a critical task in financial services. Poor model selection can lead to financial loss, unfair decisions, or regulatory risks. This project explores how different machine learning models behave when applied to credit risk classification.

**Approach**

The project:
- Preprocessed structured credit data
- Trained and evaluated multiple ML models
- Compared model performance using standard evaluation metrics
- Analysed trade-offs relevant to real-world credit decisions

Models used include:
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machine (if applicable)

**Key Findings**
- Different models exhibit trade-offs between accuracy, interpretability, and risk
- Simpler models may be preferable in regulated decision environments
- Model evaluation must consider decision impact, not just accuracy

**Relevance to Real-World Applications**

This work demonstrates how machine learning supports responsible credit risk decisions in financial institutions, highlighting the importance of model selection, fairness, and interpretability in AI-driven systems.

**Technology Used **
- Python
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- NumPy
- Jupyter Notebook
